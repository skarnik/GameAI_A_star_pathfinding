# GameAI_A_star_pathfinding

Built with Processing for Java for my Game AI class, tested on OSX Yosemite.

Open main pde file "GameAI_A_star_pathfinding" in Processing and run sketch. (Associated class files should load up as tabs) 
Click any location in in the sketch to have the program quantize the location into a graph node, and compute the shortest path 
using A*. The code has the option of flags for displaying algorithm fill and for changing the heuristic. By default it uses Euclidean distance. 

This blog http://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html has a really great introduction to A* for anyone new to it.
